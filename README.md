> * Project Title: Virtual Reality and Algebraic Visualizations: Learning Gains and Accessibility

## General Introduction
Purpose: 
To supplement existing curriculum for manipulating algebraic expressions to better understand the concept as well as practical application. This will increase accessibility for mathematics to help with learner performance and transfer of knowledge. Algebra was chosen as it is such a major base that much of the rest of mathematics is built upon.

Research Questions:
1) Cognitive load: How does VR affect cognitive load between low and high level algebraic math skill tasks?
2) Performance/Perception: What is the difference in situational awareness (SA) measured by response time and accuracy based upon the algebraic math skill task in VR?
3) Complexity: How does VR affect how participants handle the difference between low and high level complexity of algebraic math skill tasks?
4) Practical Application: How does VR help learners understand algebraic skills and their transfer between similar and distinct applications? (between classroom and practical applications)

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

(I tell sutdents to answer the questions, one paragaph each to start if you are lost)

(Problem Statement. One paragraph to describe the prob-lem that you are tackling.)

(Motivation. Why is this problem interesting and relevant to the research community?)

(Proposed Solution. How do we propose to tackle this problem (that has been identified in the previous para-graphs, is interesting to the community, and has yet to be tackled by other researchers)?)

(Contributions. An enumeration of the contributions of the senior design project)

(This project makes the following contributions:)(you must have this!!)
•	(Contribution 1)
•	(Contribution 2)
Justification-- This project could help:
	Increase ease of learning,
	Decrease frustration with math,
Increase accessibility to STEM careers for underrepresented groups
